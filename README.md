Project 3: Arcade Game
======================
This project is part of the Front-end developer nanodegree @ Udacity.
I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine.
I decided to slightly tweek the Engine to have more control of it.
In the classes.js I defined the class for the game.
In the menus.js are defined the various game menus.
The maps.js contains the instructions for the Engine on how to render levels and
maps.
In the app.js are defined the game functions.
